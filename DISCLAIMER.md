# ⚠️ Security & Usage Disclaimer

**Project:** NIBBLE (v1.7.7)
**Classification:** Tactical Obfuscation Utility

### 1. Purpose
Nibble is designed for **obfuscation** and **operational stealth**. Its primary strength is its low digital footprint and the absence of traditional cryptographic headers that trigger automated surveillance filters.

### 2. Risk Assessment
Nibble is a logic-shift tool. It is not intended to replace FIPS-validated encryption (like AES-256) for the protection of high-value state secrets. 
* **The "Human Factor":** Security depends entirely on the secrecy of the **Shared Hook**.
* **The "Bait" Factor:** Users must remain synchronized via UTC time to maintain the rotation logic.

### 3. Liability
This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. Nibble is intended for educational, research, and private communication purposes. Users are responsible for complying with local regulations regarding the use of obfuscation tools.
